    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>“Short”ribs </strong> come from the beef chuck portion of a cow
      and there are usually five of these small pieces of meat that are too
      small to be sold as good steaks. So, they are exactly what the name
      implies; short (small) ribs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Braising</strong> is a cooking method where you brown the meat and
      simmer it on low heat. You don’t need any special equipment to braise
      ribs. First, brown or sear the ribs at a high temperature then cook them
      in liquid at a lower temperature for a longer period of time. This is an
      excellent cooking method for tougher cuts of meat that will become tender
      after prolonged cooking!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>4 slices bacon, cut into ½-inch pieces</li>
      <li>3 ½ pounds beef short ribs</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>6 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves stripped</li>
      <li>1 bay leaf</li>
      <li>1 onion, diced</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 cup dry sherry</li>
      <li>1 quart beef broth</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning
        occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer crisped
        bacon with a slotted spoon to a Dutch oven. Keep bacon drippings in the
        skillet.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>Generously season short ribs with salt and pepper.</li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Heat bacon drippings in the skillet over high heat. Cook short ribs in
        hot drippings until browned and caramelized on all sides, 3 to 5 minutes
        per side. Transfer ribs to a Dutch oven, reserving drippings in the
        skillet. Add thyme and bay leaf to the Dutch oven. Set aside.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Reduce heat to medium. Cook and stir onion in the skillet until soft and
        golden, 5 to 10 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about
        30 seconds.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Whisk flour into onion mixture and stir until mixture becomes paste-like
        and light golden brown, 1 to 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Pour sherry into onion mixture; cook until thick and hot, about 2
        minutes. Pour onion-sherry mixture into the Dutch oven; pour in beef
        broth and season with salt. Bring to a simmer and cover the Dutch oven
        with a lid.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Transfer the Dutch oven to the preheated oven and cook until short ribs
        are fork-tender, about 2 hours. Remove ribs to a serving dish, reserving
        sauce in the pot.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Set Dutch oven over high heat and boil sauce until reduced and slightly
        thickened, about 10 minutes. Spoon reduced sauce over ribs.
      </li>
    </ol>
