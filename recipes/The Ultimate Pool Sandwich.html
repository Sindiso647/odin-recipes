    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      Take a dip into this glorious stuffed sandwich this summer! The bread is
      baked with a butter and mustard mixture before being filled with meats,
      cheeses, and lettuce.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>1 round bread loaf</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons yellow mustard</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded iceberg lettuce</li>
      <li>1/2 pound sliced deli ham</li>
      <li>1/2 pound sliced deli turkey</li>
      <li>6 slices Swiss cheese</li>
      <li>6 slices Cheddar or Colby Jack cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Cut a wide circle out of the bread loaf top like you’re making a soup
        bread bowl. Carefully remove and set aside the loaf top.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Hollow out the bread interior, being careful not to break through the
        sides. The loaf interior can be used to make croutons, so there’s no
        waste.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Melt butter with mustard in the microwave for 15 seconds in a small
        bowl. Mix well.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Brush butter mixture onto the exterior of the bread loaf and top; place
        loaf and top on a baking sheet.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Let cool.</li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Pat lettuce dry and place a layer in the bottom of the hollowed-out
        loaf. Layer cheese over lettuce. Add a layer of ham and turkey. Repeat
        until the loaf is full. Top with reserved bread top.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Wrap sandwich in plastic wrap and put on a baking sheet. Place another
        baking sheet on top with something to weigh it down.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Place the completed sandwich on the baking sheet in the refrigerator for
        at least 1 hour or overnight.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>Keep the sandwich whole or cut it into easy triangular sections.</li>
    </ol>
